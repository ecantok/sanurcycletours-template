                                                Great way to see more - lots of fun My wife and I loved the morning tour we
                                                did today - picked up on time at our hotel at 630 and we were off cycling
                                                before 7 (good to be out early to beat the heat). Lovely mix of busy streets
                                                (the traffic is not an issue, very courteous and didn’t feel in danger at
                                                any time) and quiet laneways. Really takes you behind the scenes. Morning
                                                tea stop in the rice paddies with lovely Indonesian treats and then onto a
                                                really good coffee at Bellissimo. Back to beach through laneways and then
                                                cycled the length of the beach broad walk. 21kms all up which was great.

                                                I didn’t have any experience with bike riding, but keep fairly fit. I did
                                                the tour to Ubud and back this morning. What a fabulous experience. Sanur
                                                Cycle Tours are very professional, picked up on time, taken to starting
                                                point, introduced to guide and Shane, set up on bike and off. I will admit I
                                                was pretty nervous at first, but I want soon enjoying the whole thing. My
                                                first ride, 52klms. Got to be happy with that. Thanks to Ivan and the great
                                                crew, you just may see me agin.

                                                We had a lovely guide Annie, who spoke great English and was very
                                                entertaining. We started off from the office, and biked to the markets. Had
                                                a good look around and purchased a few items, then to the beach, where we
                                                biked along the path and stopped for the breakfast that was provided. Food
                                                is personal choice and my husband ate his but it wasn't to my taste. After
                                                short ride along the beach we stopped at a cafe on the beach for a coffee.
                                                and then it was off to the rice fields. We were lucky to have a nice breeze
                                                to cool us down. Enjoyed the stop at the Beatles Cavern to see all the
                                                memorabilia of the Beatles era. The streets we rode on were not busy even
                                                the main street, so not scary. It was a fun ride but would like to have had
                                                a gell seat like Annie had. A bike ride worth doing.

                                                We booked our tour really late the evening prior to our departure. Without
                                                any issues Ivan and his professional team were able to organise a great
                                                morning tour for us around the beautiful village of Sanur. It was great
                                                getting to see parts of the village that are often missed, such as the
                                                markets and turtle sanctuary. I couldn't be more impressed with Sanur Cycle

                                                early for it). We rode through back streets, along the beach and through the
                                                rice fields. The guide was very informative and I very much enjoyed the
                                                local knowledge and tasting some of the local cuisine at the market. It was
                                                an easy pace and would suit most fitness levels. We had regular stops and

                                                Surprisingly few hills, and the trails have hardly any people around. Get a
                                                real feel for local life as you mostly ride through the farms and rice
                                                fields. Ivan put this together for me last minute and worked around me being
                                                solo, even found me a riding buddy. Dewi knows her way around the rice
                                                fields like the back of her hand, and we came back a different way from the
                                                way we had gone to ubud. Food was delicious, great company, and amazing
                                                scenery! The company has a local masseuse who is fairly priced for how good
                                                she is. She has a wealth of experience, having studied and worked all over
                                                the world, and she is really kind and has fabulous hands! I’ve booked her
                                                for another 2 massages on my return to Sanur before leaving Bali. Thanks
                                                heaps for everything Ivan, I will be back to do a multi-day tour with you
                                                next time.

                                                Having booked the cycling experience before leaving Australia I was a little
                                                worried about how it would go. Hubby and I are in our early 60's but still
                                                quite physicaly active but adding the Bali heat to this we were a little
                                                concerned. Need not to have been. Cycle tour starts at owner Ivans home
                                                where we were measured for our bikes and helmets and proceeds to the local
                                                markets where we met one of our guides Mother. He told us about his family
                                                and his life growing up and we did the same about our lives back is
                                                Australia. The ride to Sanur beach was an easy one and despite being on
                                                major throughfares, we felt safe and cared for at all times. We viewed where
                                                the turtles are hatched awaiting their return to the ocean as well as seeing
                                                some adult turtles. Checked out the Man Shed and an interesting display of
                                                Beatles memorabilia. We had morning tea (purchased fresh from the markets
                                                that morning) with Komang and Wayan by some rice fields/watermelon fields
                                                and gradually returned to our starting point. A visit to a temple a must.
                                                The ride was easy, the company great and we were cared for and checked on
                                                through out the ride. Would definately recommend using this company and will
                                                be back to do another ride on our next visit.

                                                Thank you team for a great days experience and for encouraging me that I
                                                could bike both ways 53.8km as I am a very small time bike user back home.
                                                If you want to see the other side of beautiful Bali, get off the beach and
                                                take a tour, there is nothing to regret.

                                                My partner and I went on the Jurassic Park morning cycle and had such a
                                                great start to the day with Maria and Wayan! Ivan and his team are super
                                                helpful and wanted to make sure everything was perfect for our cycle tour,
                                                especially as there had been a surprise downpour in the middle of the night.
                                                We loved getting to see the park on all its ruins and hearing about the
                                                local area with our lovely guides. A really wonderful way to see hidden
                                                parts of Sanur that we wouldn’t have been able to see if it weren’t for
